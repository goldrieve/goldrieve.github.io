subtitle: Parasitologist who dables in informatics
---

I'm a PhD researcher in the Matthews lab. I started the [Hosts, Pathogens and Global Health (HPGH)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-infectious-diseases/teaching/phd-programmes/hosts-pathogens-global-health) PhD programme in 2018. After a year of roatation projects in three labs in Edinburgh, I settled in the Institute of Infection and Immununology. 

I study the infamous _T. brucei_, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The subspecies I study are developmentally incompentant and I aim to identify the cause of this incompetance through multi-omic approach. I will then validate these predictions through CRISPR/ RNAi based manipulations. Through this project I hope to gain further insights into the genetic basis of development in _T. brucei_.  

The HPGH programme is interdiciplinary at heart and as such, the programme has set me up for a PhD at the interface between informatics, molecular biology, and parasitology.
