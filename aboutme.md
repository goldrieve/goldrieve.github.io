I'm a PhD researcher in the Matthews lab. I started the [Hosts, Pathogens and Global Health (HPGH)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-infectious-diseases/teaching/phd-programmes/hosts-pathogens-global-health) PhD programme in 2018 and after a year of rotation projects, I settled in the Institute of Infection and Immununology. 

I study the infamous _T. brucei_, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The subspecies I study are developmentally incompentant and I aim to predict the genomic basis of incompetance through multi-omic approach. I will validate my predictions through CRISPR and RNAi manipulations. Through this project, I hope to gain further insights into the basis of _T. brucei_ development.  

The HPGH programme is interdiciplinary at heart and has set me up for a PhD at the interface between informatics, molecular biology, and parasitology.
