title: About me
subtitle: Parasitologist who dables in informatics
---

I'm a PhD researcher in the Matthews lab as part of the [Hosts, Pathogens and Global Health (HPGH)](https://www.ed.ac.uk/edinburgh-infectious-diseases/teaching/phd-programmes/hosts-pathogens-global-health) PhD programme in the Institute of Infection and Immununology, University of Edinburgh. I study a parasite which is part of an ancient branch of Eukaryote, _Trypanosoma_. I largly focus on subspecies of the infamous _T. brucei_, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The subspecies I study are developmentally incompentant and I aim to identify the cause of this incompetance, which will of course provide further insights into the genetic basis of development in _T. brucei_.  

The HPGH programme is interdiciplinary at heart and as such, the porgramme has set me up for a PhD at the interface between informatics, molecular biology, and parasitology.
