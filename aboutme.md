## Currently

Hosts, Pathogens and Global Health (HPGH) PhD Candidate

### Specialized in

Interdiciplinary research at the interface between informatics, molecular biology, and parasitology.

### Research interests

I study the infamous _T. brucei_, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. The subspecies I study are developmentally incompentant and I aim to predict the genomic basis of incompetance through multi-omic approach. I will validate my predictions through CRISPR and RNAi manipulations. Through this project, I hope to gain further insights into the basis of T. brucei development.
