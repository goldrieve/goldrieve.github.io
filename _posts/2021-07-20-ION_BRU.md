## The genomic basis of host/ vector specificity - ION_BRU talk

Check out my [talk](https://www.dropbox.com/s/18aknsnubf061zk/9.%20Guy%20Oldrieve-%20host%20%26%20vector%20specificity%20in%20trypanosomatids.mp4?dl=0) on _T. melophagium_ for [ION_BRU](https://twitter.com/ion_bru) (the Scottish nanopore user group). The work was very rough and ready at this stage so I am excited to share more recent updates soon.
