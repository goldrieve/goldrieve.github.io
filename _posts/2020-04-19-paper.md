Our paper on monomorphic _Trypanozoon_ phylogeney is now up as a [preprint!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439642v1.full)

This manuscript represents the first steps in my PhD, hunting for the basis of monomorphism (developmental incompetence) in the infamous _T. brucei_. This project was mainly completed during the lockdown and I really enjoyed it as it brought together collaborators from the diverse fields of evolutionary biology and parasite diagnostics.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45576436/115294442-82de6280-a150-11eb-95cd-f36611240cd4.png)
