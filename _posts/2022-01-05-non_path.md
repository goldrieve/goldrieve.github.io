## The genomic basis of host/ vector specificity

Really excited to have our work on the _T. melophagium_ genome, and its comparison to _T. theileri_ up as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.05.475049v1). The project started as an honours project for Beatrice, a fantastic unergrad student, but aso provided a much needed raction from lockdown life!
