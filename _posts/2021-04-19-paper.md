This [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.14.439642v1.full) represents the first steps in my PhD, hunting for the basis of monomorphism (developmental incompetence) in the infamous _T. brucei_. This project was mainly completed during lockdown and I really enjoyed it as it brought together collaborators from the diverse fields of evolutionary biology and parasite diagnostics.
