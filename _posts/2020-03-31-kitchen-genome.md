## Motivation

As with many folk during the long dark winter months, I needed something to keep me busy and the thought of sequencing a genome on my kitchen table was enough to get me up in the morning. As part of my PhD I have been working with Oxford Nanopore's miniature genome sequencer and with the idea of using it in resource poor settings, I decided to give it a trial run in the barren wastelands of Gorgie, Edinburgh.  
In the Matthew's lab, we work on a broad diversity of the ancient protozoan genus, _Trypanosoma_. _T. melophagium_ is a fascinating example of a _Trypanosoma_ which in contrast to the more infamous species, is non-pathogenic. _T. melophagium_ can be found in temperate regions where pesticide has not be widely used, such as the barren and desolate isles of St. Kilda, off of the Scottish coast. _T. melophagium_ is transmitted from host to host (_Ovinus_) via the sheep ked. It is supposedly closely rleated to another _Trypanosoma_, _T. theileri_ which can be found in similar climates but is transmitted between bovids via tabanids.  
Interest has grown around these trypanosomes as researchers in the Matthews's lab, and futher afield, have begun a study using _T. melophagium_ or _T. theileri_ as a [vaccine vechicle](https://roslintech.com/roslin-technologies-building-breakthrough-vaccine-vehicle-for-sheep-and-goats-using-trypanosomes/).

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
