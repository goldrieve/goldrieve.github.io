## Motivation

The aim is to maintain our mental and physical health whilst raising money for Mind in the process. Its a tough ol' time right now so hopefully this will go some way to helping a few folk out. The total distance is 480km and we both aim to run, cycle or swim the distance during the month! To spice things up, we'll be chucking in a few extra challenges along the way.
